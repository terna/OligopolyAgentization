\begin{itemize}

\item
Do entry, exit and changes in market structure affect the macroeconomy?

\item Is there a link between the strategic interactions among oligopolistic firms and the macroeconomic equilibrium?

\end{itemize}

\small
This questions are certainly not trivial in modern economies, where large oligopolistic firms play a relevant role and so many meetings among statesmen have the explicit scope of promoting contracts for some large and important firms of their countries. 

However, surprisingly enough, the most popular theoretical models in the modern macroeconomic literature hardly see any explicit formalization for the macroeconomic effects of changes in market structure, entry, exit and strategic interactions among oligopolists.
